# Search_Algorithm
We have 8 problems here. Each of them requires implementing a search algorithm. 

The problems are as follows:
1. DFS-GSA
2. BFS-GSA
3. UCS-GSA
4. Greedy
5. A*
6. 8 Queens Local Search
7. 8 Queens Local Search - a better board

We use `parse.py` to read the problems in `test_cases` folder and run the search algorithms on them.

Below are the steps to test.

Run a single test case
```bash
python p1.py 1
```
Run all test cases for one problem.
```bash
python p1.py -6
```

Run all test cases for all problems.
```bash
python grade.py
```
